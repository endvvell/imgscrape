Robust image scraping script for static websites.

Works on:
* Static websites.
* Image files that are not activated by JS.
* Websites that allow scraping.


Usage:
(with an argument):
- python3 imgscrape.py 'your_url_here'

(or without):
- python3 imgscrape.py


To run:
1. Open terminal in the same folder as the script. (or mention the absolute path to the script in step 2)
2. Type 'python3 imgscrape.py' and press the magic button.


All scraped files can be found in 'imgFiles' folder, which will get created in the parent folder if it doesn't already exist.
